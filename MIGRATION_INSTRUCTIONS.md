# âœ… Your App is Ready to Use!

## ðŸŽ‰ Great News!

Your app now uses **localStorage** to save your data! This means:

- âœ… **No Supabase account needed**
- âœ… **No migration required**
- âœ… Your income won't be asked again
- âœ… Your expenses persist after sign out
- âœ… Everything works immediately!

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The app automatically saves your data to your browser's localStorage. This means:

1. **Set your income once** - it will be remembered!
2. **Add expenses** - they'll persist
3. **Sign out and back in** - your data is still there!
4. **Close and reopen the app** - everything persists!

## ðŸ”„ Optional: Database Storage

If you want to use database storage instead of localStorage (for syncing across devices), you can optionally run the migration:

### How to Run Migration (Optional)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/quqzvazllchualjgbymw/sql/new
2. Run this SQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS monthly_income NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expenses JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
```

**Note:** This is optional! The app works great with localStorage alone.

## âœ… You're All Set!

Just use the app normally - your data will persist automatically! ðŸŽ‰
